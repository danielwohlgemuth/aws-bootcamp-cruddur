# AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp

In this repository I keep a journal of my progress as I work through the [AWS Cloud Complete Bootcamp Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8guDqfv40) taught by [Andrew Brown](https://github.com/omenking) in order to demonstrate my experience using AWS.

The project is about building an ephemeral microblogging site called Cruddur. Think of it like X (Twitter) with expiring messages.

This is an approximate diagram of the architecture the project will have.

## Gitpod

Gitpod is a service that allows you to launch a preconfigured development environment. It helps keep a consistent environment between developers working on the same project.
