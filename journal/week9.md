# Week 9 â€” CI/CD with CodePipeline, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy

Week 9 was a short week as it only involved setting up a CI/CD pipeline.

The pipeline has 3 stages:
- Source
- Build
- Deploy

The pipeline starts to run when a pull request gets merged into the `prod` branch on GitHub.

The `Source` stage then bundles the source code into a zip file and uploads it as an artifact to an S3 bucket.

The `Build` stage uses the uploaded artifact to build a container image and pushes it to the Elastic Container Registry.

The `Deploy` stage signals the Elastic Container Service to update the service, which causes it to pull the latest container image.
